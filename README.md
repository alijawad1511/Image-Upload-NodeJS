# Image Upload to Server

This is a project in which I have used multer library of NodeJS to upload image to server side by client.

### Procedure

When a client selects an image from his device, and click upload button, Image will be stored on the server side in a folder called "uploads".
I have created "uploads" folder in public folder just to show images on client side. You can create folder on server side and can change path to that folder to upload put images in that folder.
